Using the Python programming language write a program to do a counting sort. 

This will require that you learn on your own how to install and use Python to accomplish this task. Give yourself at least a couple of hours to set up Python. There are several options including IDEs that you can choose. I usually use VS Code with Python tools. You may also need to install Python on your computer. Use a recent version of Python 3. 

If you know Python and have everything installed the programming portion should only take a couple of hours. Give yourself plenty of time for unexpected issues. On more than one occasion I have had to reinstall Python in order to get things to work correctly, but normally this should not be an issue.

The counting sort is explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sortLinks to an external site.

Generate an array of 1 million random integer values from 0 to 100 inclusive of the ends.

Use Python sortLinks to an external site. to verify your algorithm.  

Use Python random.randint in a list comprehension to generate the numbers.

Use a Python loop to generate the numbers.

Compare the time for the loop version vs. using list comprehension. 

Use the Python time.perf_counter()Links to an external site. or equivalent to measure execution time.

Is your sort faster than the built-in sort of Python?

Provide output that shows that your sort and the built-in Python sort produce the same result.

Make sure you do everything that is asked. If you are confused contact me well ahead of the due date.
