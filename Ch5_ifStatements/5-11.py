# 5-11. Ordinal Numbers: Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a list, such 
# as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.
# â€¢	 Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a list.
# â€¢	 Loop through the list.
# â€¢	 Use an if-elif-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number. Your output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 
# 7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line
