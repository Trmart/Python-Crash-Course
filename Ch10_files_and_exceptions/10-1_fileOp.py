# 10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few 
# lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line 
# with the phrase In Python you can.... Save the file as learning_python.txt in the 
# same directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads 
# the file and prints what you wrote three times. Print the contents once by reading in the entire file, 
# once by looping over the file object, and once by storing 
# the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.
